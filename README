The author of higan (byuu) prefers package managers not to download
the sources from his homepage, so we keep this mirror for GNU Guix.

Note that the sources are not version-controlled by the author.  This
repository is updated to new releases via the following steps after
each release by the author:

1. Remove all files and directories except `add-gitkeep-files.sh`.
2. Extract the new sources.
3. Run `add-gitkeep-files.sh`.
4. Commit all changes and tag the commit.

The `.gitkeep` files are necessary because git does not track empty
directories.

The other git mirror of the sources at GitLab are not always up to
date, not always properly tagged, and the owner of the repository
might not always be possible to contact, should the GNU Guix
maintainers need to do so.
